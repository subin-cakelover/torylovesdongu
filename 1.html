For the first time patients are active decesion makers and healthcare industry needs to treat them as partners or deal with the consequences.
And although all lights are on data science and its impact on diagnostics,
<strong>the dark horse of modern healthcare is <u>User Experience Design</u>.</strong>

After many years of investing in internal software for hospitals and medical professionals, a huge new market opened a while ago for health app and software development in B2C (business-to-consumer, or rather healthcare-to-patient).
And it will only grow - World Health Organization calculated the cost of not taking action to address the spread of noncommunicable diseases - 7 trillion dollars in 20 years. And unhealthy consumer decisions are mostly to be blamed.
When you first sit to design a new UX for a health product or service, the task might seem daunting.
The typical models implemented in B2C strategies won't be of much help, as they're usually not intended for highly regulated industries.
